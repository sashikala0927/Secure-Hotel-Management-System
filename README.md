This project simulates a Secure Hotel Management Network built using Cisco Packet Tracer, designed to provide secure and efficient communication between multiple departments of a hotel while preventing unauthorized access.

The network is segmented into multiple VLANs for different hotel departments including Reception, Guest Wi-Fi, Administration, CCTV Surveillance, IT, and Services. Inter-VLAN communication is controlled through Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure privacy and security.

Routers are interconnected via serial WAN links using OSPF dynamic routing for efficient route updates. Port Security is implemented on critical access ports to restrict the number of allowed devices and prevent MAC spoofing or unauthorized switch connections.

Key Features:

- 3-Router Topology connected with Serial DCE/DTE links for WAN simulation
- Multiple VLANs for network segmentation (Reception, Guests, Admin, CCTV, IT, Services)
- OSPF Routing for automatic route exchange
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized inter-VLAN communication
- Port Security to prevent unauthorized device connections
- CCTV VLAN Simulation with restricted access from Security PCs only
- Scalable Design for future network expansion
- 
This project demonstrates practical network design and security principles applicable in real-world hospitality IT infrastructure, combining routing, switching, and security configurations into a fully functional simulation.
